# CO-PO Mapping 📚

## Overview 🌍
CO-PO Mapping is a systematic approach used in Outcome-Based Education (OBE) to establish a correlation between Course Outcomes (COs) and Program Outcomes (POs). This process ensures that the learning objectives of a course align with the broader goals of a program, facilitating measurable and structured learning outcomes.

---

## Key Terminologies 📝
- **Course Outcomes (CO):** Specific and measurable statements describing what students will learn by completing a course.
- **Program Outcomes (PO):** Broad competencies that students are expected to achieve by the end of a program.
- **Rubric Range:** A scoring guide used for evaluating the quality of student responses, aiding in CO attainment calculations.

---

## Features ✨
1. **Mapping Process:**
   - Faculty members map each CO to relevant POs using evaluators.
   - Evaluators measure the strength of the correlation on a scale (e.g., Low - 1, Medium - 2, High - 3).

2. **Rubric Configuration:**
   - Faculty can define or update rubric ranges for CO attainment calculations.

3. **Attainment Calculation:**
   - The mapping helps calculate whether specific learning outcomes are achieved.

4. **Customization:**
   - Faculty can edit existing mappings or configure new rubric ranges.

## Steps for CO-PO Mapping 🔄
1. Navigate to the course file and access the "CO-PO Mapping" section.
2. Select the appropriate evaluator for each CO-PO pair.
3. If no correlation exists, leave the evaluator unselected.
4. Save the mapping once all selections are made.
5. Configure or update rubric ranges as required.
